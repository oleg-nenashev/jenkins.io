The Cloud Native group of contributors and collaborators focuses on
improving Jenkins to run on Cloud environments as a "Cloud Native" application.

=== Target Audience

The improvements are targeted at both existing and new Jenkins users that use, or would prefer to use,
Jenkins deployed in one of the cloud providers,
or using cloud services for their operation.

=== Meetings

There will be regular SiG meetings scheduled.
Initially the meetings will be conducted once per month,
then they may be adapted according to the activity.

Meetings will be conducted and recorded via Jenkins Hangouts-on-Air.
