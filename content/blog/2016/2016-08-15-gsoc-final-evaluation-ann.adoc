On this year Jenkins project participates in Google Summer of Code 2016. 
On this year we had 5 students working on different areas in the Jenkins core, plugins and the project infrastructure. 
You can read more about student projects link:TODO[here].

On June we had mid-term evaluation of students. 
You can find links to the description and video recordings link:TODO[in this blogpost].
After this evaluation 3 projects have been cancelled. 
But we still have 2 students: Alexandru Somai and Samat Davletsin.

On August 25 we will conduct a Jenkins online meetup, where the students will present their final results. 
You can register to these meetup link:TODO[here].

==== Abstracts

===== External Workspace Manager Plugin

Currently, Jenkinsâ€™ build workspace may become very large in size due to the fact that some compilers generate very large volumes of data. 
One of solutions is to have a Jenkins plugin that is able to manage and reuse the same workspace between multiple builds.

link:TODO[External Workspace Manager Plugin] provides a workspace management system for link:TODO[Jenkins Pipeline]. 
It facilitates workspace share and reuse across multiple Jenkins jobs running on different nodes. 
It eliminates the need to copy, archive or move files. 
Plugin also supports automatic workspace cleanup, multiple disk pools and flexible disk selection management.

During the presentation Alex will overview the plugin and its common use-cases.
There will be also a short demo of the plugin.
