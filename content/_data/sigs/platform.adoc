The special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc.

The SiG works on defining platform support policies,
coordinating platform support efforts with contributors and external communities,
and reviewing proposals in the area.
