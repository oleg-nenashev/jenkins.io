The Cloud Native group of contributors and collaborators focuses on
improving Jenkins to run on Cloud environments as a "Cloud Native" application.

The improvements are targeted at both existing and new Jenkins users that use, or would prefer to use,
Jenkins deployed in one of the cloud providers,
or using cloud services for their operation.
